    "To solve this problem, we can use the Bayes' theorem which states that the posterior probability of a class (C1 or C2) given an observation (x) is proportional to the likelihood of the observation given the class times the prior probability of the class.  (a) To determine which values of x should be classified in C1 and which values in C2, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities P(C1|x) and P(C2|x) for each x in [0, 2] and classify x in the class with the higher posterior probability.  The posterior probabilities are calculated as follows:  P(C1|x) = p(x|C1) * P(C1) / p(x) P(C2|x) = p(x|C2) * P(C2) / p(x)  where p(x) is the total probability of x and can be calculated as p(x) = p(x|C1) * P(C1) + p(x|C2) * P(C2).  (b) The cost λij represents the cost of misclassification. If we want the classification intervals of x for C1 and C2 to be [0, 1] and [1, 2] respectively, we need to set the costs λ12 and λ21 such that the expected cost of misclassification is minimized. This can be achieved by setting λ12 = λ21 = ∞ for x in [0, 1] and λ12 = λ21 = 0 for x in [1, 2].  Here is a Python code that calculates the posterior probabilities and classifies the values of x:"
